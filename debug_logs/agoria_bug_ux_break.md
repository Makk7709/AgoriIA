# AgorIA UX Implementation Debug Log

## Current Status

- Application builds successfully
- Server starts on port 3000
- No immediate build errors
- HTTP requests returning 200 status codes

## Component Analysis

### ResponseForm.tsx

- Properly implemented with TypeScript types
- Handles user responses correctly
- No immediate issues detected

### Feedback.tsx

- Imports LoadingSpinner correctly
- Has proper error handling
- Potential issue: Not being used in main Scoreboard component

### LoadingSpinner.tsx

- Properly implemented and exported
- Used correctly in both Feedback and Scoreboard components
- No issues detected

### Scoreboard/index.tsx

- Main component handling score calculation
- Uses LoadingSpinner correctly
- Potential issue: Missing Feedback component integration

## Potential Issues

1. **Component Integration**
   - Feedback component is not being used in the main Scoreboard
   - Missing props might be causing runtime errors

2. **Score Calculation**
   - `calculateAlignmentScores` function might be throwing errors
   - No error handling visible in the logs

3. **State Management**
   - Multiple state variables might be causing race conditions
   - Confirmation states might be interfering with each other

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Component Integration**
   - Check if Feedback component should be integrated into Scoreboard
   - Verify all required props are being passed

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add more comprehensive error handling in score calculation
   - Implement proper error boundaries

3. **State Management**
   - Review state management approach
   - Consider using a more robust state management solution

## Recommendations

1. Add proper error boundaries around components
2. Implement comprehensive logging
3. Add proper type checking for all props
4. Consider implementing proper loading states
5. Review the integration of the Feedback component

## Environment

- Next.js 14.2.28
- TypeScript
- React
